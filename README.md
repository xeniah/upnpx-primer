upnpx-primer
============

Setting up a workspace with the UPNPX static library. I rearranged the original upnpx project a bit so that the headers reside 
in the same directory as the project meta, for ease of importing and more concise compiler instructions (User Header Search Paths, I am looking at you!).

Original instructions on how to use the static library are here: https://code.google.com/p/upnpx/wiki/Libupnpx (outdated, but the only thing that changed is that now both projects are happily in same workspace - build settings instructions are still valid).
